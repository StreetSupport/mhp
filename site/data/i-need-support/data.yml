    to expect&lt;/b&gt;&#10; &#10;Your council must help if you&rsquo;re legally homeless,
    but how much depends on your eligibility, your level of need and how you became
    homeless.&#10;&#10;We know that it can be difficult trying to find the information
    you need at such a challenging time so we have put together the below information
    which we hope will help you understand some of the terminology around homelessness:&#10;

    from your family or people you normally live with because there&rsquo;s no suitable
    accommodation for you &#10;* You&rsquo;re living in very poor conditions such
    as overcrowding &#10;&#10;If you&rsquo;re legally homeless, your council must
    provide you with help &ndash; this could range from giving advice to arranging
    accommodation for you. The amount of help they give you will depend on things
    like: &#10;* If you became homeless through no fault of your own &#10;* If you&rsquo;re
    eligible for assistance &#10;* If you&rsquo;re in priority need&#10;&#10;&lt;b&gt;Priority
    need&lt;/b&gt;&#10;&#10;You&rsquo;re in priority need if: &#10;* You or someone
