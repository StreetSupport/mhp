    The Manchester Homelessness Partnership (MHP) is a network of organisations
    which formed to work together towards the aims and values of the Manchester
    Homelessness Charter. Our goal is to end homelessness in all its forms in
    Manchester.


    The Charter was launched in May 2016. It unites many people with personal experience of homelessness with organisations from different sectors, to co-produce solutions together. Over 100 people who have personal insight into homelessness have been involved in the Partnership so far, many of whom co-wrote the Charter.


    The Charter and Partnership were created with no financial resource. Most of our work is
     done voluntarily by the fantastic people in our network.

    At the heart of the Partnership are our
    [Charter](https://charter.streetsupport.net/read-the-charter/) values and
    the [Actions Groups](https://mhp.org.uk/action-groups/) which tackle
    specific challenges that people who are homeless may face. Each group
    includes people who have experienced the topic in question, as well as other
    relevent organisations. 


    We have a Partnership Board of representatives from different perspectives of our city which meets to use its collective influence to remove systemic blockages. We also have a Driving Group which maintains momentum, supports the action groups, and protects the values of the Charter.


    Part of the 'glue' that holds our network together is [Street Support Network](https://streetsupport.net). They provide facilitation, connect people, and communicate between the Partnership and out to others through the website & App. We are also linked into the Greater Manchester Homelessness Action Network.

    The Manchester Homelessness Charter unites people, organisations, and
    businesses together with one shared vision and set of values. The Charter
    was co-created by people experiencing homelessness and the organisations
    which provide support services.


    _How_ we do what we do is very important to us. If you would like to be part of the Manchester Homelessness Partnership, please read the Charter and commit to working in line with our values.
