    There are lots of ways to help the Manchester Homelessness Partnership, and our aim to end homelessness in Manchester in all its forms. 


    #### Looking for advice? 


    Learn about how to get help where you are, or how you can help those facing homelessness via [Street Support](https://www.streetsupport.net). 


    #### Helping someone who is, or is at risk of being, homeless 


    ##### Help for someone sleeping rough 


    If you are worried about someone you’ve seen sleeping rough in Manchester, you can alert the Council on their [website](https://secure.manchester.gov.uk/forms/form/1183/en/report_rough_sleeping). Alternatively, you can inform Streetlink by downloading the [Streetlink app](https://www.streetlink.org.uk/).


    ##### Help for someone who has recently become homeless 


    If you want to support someone who has recently become homeless it's important to get the right advice as soon as possible. The first thing to do is contact Manchester City Council on 0161 234 4692 between 9am to 4.30pm, Monday to Friday (except bank holidays) for help and support. When the office is closed, phone the out of hours line: 0161 234 5001 


    Help for someone at risk of losing their home 


    There are several support and advice services that help people to understand their options, including: 


    * [Shelter](https://england.shelter.org.uk/get_help) - a national charity with housing advice on a range of issues. 

    * [Citizen's Advice](https://www.citizensadvice.org.uk/housing/) - impartial advice and information about housing, benefits, debt, work and more. Call their advice line on [0808 278 7800](tel:08082787800).
