    Real Change MCR is a fund to help people experiencing homelessness pay for
    practical items that they need to build lives away from the streets. The
    fund is used by Manchester homelessness organisations and charities who
    provide long-term support on the journey to independent living. Examples of
    how the funding can be used include a deposit for a new home, a training
    course, clothes for a job interview or furnishing a new home.


    Real Change MCR has been supporting people who have experienced homelessness since 2016, raising over £310,000 and helping over 1,600 people in Manchester.
