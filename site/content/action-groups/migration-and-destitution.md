    This group brings together people with lived experience of migrant
    destitution, and frontline organisations who support them. In
    partnership with Macc, the group manages the [Greater Manchester Migrant
    Destitution Fund](https://www.migrantdestitution.co.uk/), which provides
    cash grants to those forced into destitution by their immigration status.
    The group also supports campaigns for longer term change. The group includes
    members from Boaz Trust, Growing Together Levenshulme, Equal Education
    Chances, Asylum Matters and others. The co-chairs are Andy Muzondiwa and
    William Wheeler.[](<>)
