    The Emergency and Temporary Accommodation Action Group aims to raise the
    standards of emergency accommodation in Manchester.  The group has set out a
    vision for emergency accommodation for 2022, as well as setting minimum
    standards for now.


    Achievements of the group include drawing up the vision and minimum standards, getting these adopted by the MHP and Manchester City Council and they now form the basis for the commissioning of these services.


    The minimum standards and vision for 2022 are to ensure that Manchester has the highest possible standards for emergency accommodation to help people who are rough sleeping to make the choice to move inside. These standards have been drawn up with people who have experience of staying in emergency accommodation and people who provide and commission accommodation and support services.
