    **The Mental Health Action Group (MHAG) aims to improve Mental Health
    provision for people experiencing homelessness**, through looking into
    issues with accessing mental health support, missing services, and also
    supporting therapies and activities that could be provided by the
    volunteers.


    F﻿rom 2016 to the beginning of 2022, **Inspiring Change Manchester** chaired MHAG because of how many people their services were seeing struggling with both mental health issues and homelessness. MHAG is built on co-production, with all decisions being made equally by the group. 


    T﻿he group's founding aim was to produce a piece of **peer-led research** and, and they produced not one, but two reports - *Causes & Consequences*, and *It's My Medication.* The findings of the *Causes & Consequences* report have been used to establish a homelessness operational group at the Greater Manchester Mental Health Trust, garnering both local and national attention


    > "Systems and services are simplified and connected so it’s easier to navigate them." - from the Mental Health Action Group's Causes and Consequences report
