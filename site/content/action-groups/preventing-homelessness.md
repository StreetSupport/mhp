  subHeading: Effecting sustainable systems change in homelessness prevention
  body: >-
    The Prevention Action Group aims to affect sustainable systems change in
    homelessness prevention, through **finding new solutions in preventing all
    types of homelessness** and ensuring that the voice of the community is
    heard.  


    After relaunching in 2022, the group is looking at **mapping prevention services across the city, and lobbying for systems change.** 


    > Homelessness prevention should be about proactively building wellbeing and participation, as well as taking steps to respond effectively when people need help.


    The group is chaired by Manchester City Council, the Booth Centre and Mustard Tree, and a wide range of services and individuals attend, including from Barnabus, Lifeshare, and Manchester Women’s Aid. 


    **Membership is open,** and is particularly sought from people with personal experience of homelessness & homeless services in Manchester, and from people working in the sector.
