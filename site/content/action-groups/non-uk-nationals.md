  body: >-
    The Homelessness and Migration Action Group aims to effect positive change
    for non-UK nationals experiencing homelessness in Manchester, by **using
    knowledge, lived experience and expertise** from attendees of the action
    group and their wider reach. The group aims to be pro-active and positive,
    focusing on all aspects of homelessness. 


    > "Non-UK nationals are more vulnerable to homelessness than people with UK citizenship, and those with restricted or undetermined eligibility for public funds even more so." - from Crisis report 'A Home For All'


    After launching at the end of 2022, the group voted to decide the first topic of focus for the group –**how non–UK nationals with restricted eligibility to public funds can access accommodation.** The group has begun to design a toolkit which can be of use to frontline services and people experiencing these issues themselves. It helps readers navigate the system, demystify common misconceptions and raises awareness of what support people can access no matter what your immigration status.


    Organisations involved in the group include the Boaz Trust, Greater Manchester Immigration Aid Unit, Greater Together Manchester and the Mustard Tree, as well as other organisations that work with Non-UK nationals, and people with lived experience.  


    **Any person or organisation interested in improving the lives of non-UK nationals experiencing homelessness in Manchester is welcome to attend this group!**
