    **The Co-production Action Group aims to** **ensure that people with lived
    experience are involved in the partnership in a meaningful way.** Other
    Action Groups and the Board can bring projects, plans for advice about how
    to embed the voices of people with experience of homelessness in the design
    and delivery of those projects. 


    > *Full co-production means sharing power – giving people who use services an equal chance to sit at the table and make decisions about how to run it better. - Homeless Link, 2018*


    S﻿ome examples of projects that the group has worked on include **putting on co – production training for co – chairs of other action groups.** They are looking to do another set of training, even more enriching, for people within the MHP and outside agencies. It will focus on informing people with lived experience on how to get involved in homeless strategy projects and how organisations can involve these people as well.

    T﻿he Booth Centre were invited to support [Homeless Link](https://www.homeless.org.uk/co-production-toolkit) in the development of their **Co-production Toolkit,** to support other homeless services in integrating a culture of genuine co-production in their organisations. 


    **To get involved,** please contact the co-chair harris@boothcentre.org.uk to find out more. He is particularly calling on people with lived experience from outside the Booth Centre to join the group.
