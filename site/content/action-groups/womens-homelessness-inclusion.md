    **What is the purpose of the group?**


    * To amplify women's experiences of homelessness, which are often overlooked

    * To ensure women with lived experience of homelessness have a safe space to meet and through meaningful involvement their voices are heard, listened to and acted on by services and decision makers 


    **What are the aims of the group?**


    * Influence providers and commissioners

    * Improve accessibility to women’s services, and make information more readily available

    * Improve knowledge for professionals to have more gender-informed and trauma-informed approach to service users


    **Why and how was the group established?**


    The group was established in late 2018, after a launch event. Street Support and Manchester Homelessness Partnership (MHP) set-up the group, because they felt that there was a need for something for women. The launch event held last in 2018 brought together about 100 women, this was co-ordinated by Street Support and co-facilitated by them and Eve Holt. From this the women said that they wanted a women’s homelessness action group and this was taken forward by MASH and Riverside for the first few meetings. 


    This action group is currently co-chaired by [Manchester Women's Aid](https://www.manchesterwomensaid.org/) and the [Booth Centre](https://www.boothcentre.org.uk/).


    **What Does Membership look like?**


    Membership of the group is open to women and those who identify as women. We aim to ensure this action group is inclusive as possible.  We invite those with lived experience, volunteers and staff who are committed to involvement and influencing change that improves women's experiences of homeless services and accommodation. There is representation from a range of organisations. There is also a key aim of encouraging representation from the local authority. there are no restrictions on numbers. 


    **How does the group work?**


    WHIG is working towards a true co-production model and is adopting these principles in it's approach through actively encouraging representation from a range of different services and individuals with lived experience coming together to do work, make decisions and listen to each other. 


    Like all MHP Action Groups, this group is working towards a shared purpose and the vision of the MHP to end homelessness. 


    There are a range of different opportunities for individuals to feed into the group via monthly face to face meetings, online access and joining the action group mailing list. 


    **Where and when does the group meet?**


    WHIG holds monthly face to face meetings at the [Booth Centre](https://www.boothcentre.org.uk/) on the last Thursday of each month from 2pm to 3pm. The address is Booth Centre, Edward Holt House, Pimblett Street, M3 1FU.
