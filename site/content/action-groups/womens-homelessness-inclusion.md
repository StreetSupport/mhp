    What is the purpose of the group?


    * To drive change towards more women’s accommodation (and women only accommodation). 


    What we mean by women only, is accommodation that is:


    * Completely separate from male accommodation

    * Small accommodation – a smaller building with fewer rooms

    * Properly staffed and trauma informed

    * To improve homeless services for women in Manchester

    * Through meaningful involvement from experts by experience to ensure women’s voices are heard, listened to and acted on by services and decision makers


    What are the aims of the group?


    * Influence providers and commissioners

    * Improve women’s emergency accommodation (and women’s experience of this)

    * Influence a more joined up and gendered approach to staff training and workplace practices

    * Improve service information available for women and access for women

      **Why and how was the group established?**

      The group was established in late 2018, after a launch event. Street Support and Manchester Homelessness Partnership (MHP) set-up the group, because they felt that there was a need for something for women. The launch event held last in 2018 brought together about 100 women, this was coordinated by Street Support and co-facilitated by them and Eve Holt. From this the women said that they wanted a women’s homelessness action group and this was taken forward by MASH and Riverside for the first few meetings.
