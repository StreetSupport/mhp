    ## Learn about our vision for ending homelessness in Manchester, and our guiding values. 


    At the centre of the Manchester Homelessness Partnership is our Charter, which unites people, organisations, and businesses together with one shared vision and set of values. The Charter was co-created by people experiencing homelessness and the organisations which provide support services. 


    How we do what we do is very important to us. If you would like to be part of the Manchester Homelessness Partnership, please read the Charter and commit to working in line with our values.
