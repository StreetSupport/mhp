      Media can be a force for telling untold stories, and a catalyst for
      change. However, a lot of the time, the media portrays people experiencing
      homelessness in a way that reinforced inaccurate and negative stereotypes,
      and the othering of people affected by homelessness.


      During 2019 and 2020, the Booth Centre Media Group discussed the negative coverage of homelessness, sharing personal experiences of homelessness and interacting with the media


      The decision was made to formalise the Booth Centre approach to the media; a focus on portraying individuals not stereotypes and telling empowering stories - not ones of victims and saviours.
